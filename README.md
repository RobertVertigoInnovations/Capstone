# Capstone
# This is the MVP minimal viable product that was part of my degree.
# The idea was that I identified a problem, which people either or misinformed or to intimidated to ask for help when working out at the gym.
# As people generally like to take to social media and mock people. I devised a way that would work with the user that would develop a workout routine with them
# Monitor their movements while doing said workout, then if done incorrectly would show the user how, if done correctly would count as a rep.
# The process is to motivate and empower the user with positive affirmations.
# Source code not included.
